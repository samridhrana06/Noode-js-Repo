// Problem 5: JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)
// You're working on a weather app. Create a JSON object representing 
// the weather forecast for
// a specific day. Include properties like 
// "date," "temperature," "conditions," and "humidity."
// Display the information using console.log.
// Remember to encourage your students to experiment and think 
// creatively while solving these
// problems. They can use the concepts you've taught them to come up 
// with their own solutions.// This will not only help solidify their
//  understanding but also foster their problem-solving skills in
// JavaScript.

const weatherForecast = {
    date : '13-3-24',
    temperature : 28,
    conditions : 'Moderate',
    humidity : 20
}

console.log("Weather Forecast for", weatherForecast.date);
console.log("Temperature:", weatherForecast.temperature + "Â°C");
console.log("Conditions:", weatherForecast.conditions);
console.log("Humidity:", weatherForecast.humidity + "%");
